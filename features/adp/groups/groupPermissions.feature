Feature: Group permissions
  As an ADP user
  Access to my groups should be restricted to a subset of users
  So that my groups information is not exposed to users that should not have access

  Scenario: As a Producer I should be able to see all the groups I created

  Scenario: As a Client Manager or any other super users I should have access to any group owned by a producer in my org

  Scenario: As a Client Manager or any other super users I should have access to any group owned by a producer in a child org of mine

  Scenario: As a Producer I should not have access to any other producers groups even if they are in my org

  Scenario: As a CS user I should have access to any group in the Quotepad application
