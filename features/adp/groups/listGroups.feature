Feature: List groups
  As a ADP user
  I need to be able view a list of groups that I have access to
  So that I can search for groups that I want to sell to

  Scenario: Groups should be nested on the group list if they contain the same group name, broker, and product lines

  Scenario: Sort groups in ascending and descending order via the group list header

  Scenario: Delete a group from the list

  Scenario: Groups are searchable via group name

  Scenario: Filter groups by group status

  Scenario: Filter groups by group type

  Scenario: Toggle the number of group displayed per page

  Scenario: The number of available groups should be displayed in the bottom left of the group list. This should update on searching or filtering
