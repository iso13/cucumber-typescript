Feature: Import Global Plans
  As a Producer
  I want to be able to import global plans
  So that I can reuse custom plans across multiple groups

  Scenario: Import a medical, dental, vision, and life plan

  Scenario: Plans imported and altered should not affect the original plan

  Scenario: To help with importing the correct plan, benefits should be displayed with their values in the list for medical, dental, vision, and life

  Scenario: Import several plans at one time should work

  Scenario: A limited number of plans should be displayed per page and I should be able to move through the pages to see more plans
