Feature: Edit plans
  As a Producer
  I want the ability to edit custom plans
  So I can make changes based on client feedback or newly released carrier updates

  Scenario: Update rates for medical, dental, vision, and life plans

  Scenario: Locked plans should be read-only and can not be updated

  Scenario: Plans can be duplicated and the duplicate plans are not lock.
