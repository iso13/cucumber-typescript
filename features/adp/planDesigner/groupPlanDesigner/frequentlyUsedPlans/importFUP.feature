Feature: Import frequently used plan
  As a Producer
  I want to be able to import frequently used plans
  So that I can reuse custom plans across multiple groups

  Scenario: Import a medical, dental, vision, and life plan

  Scenario: Plans imported and altered should not affect the original frequently used plan

  Scenario: To help with importing the correct plan, benefits should be displayed with their values in the frequently used plans  list for medical, dental, vision, and life

  Scenario: Import all frequently used plans with one click

  Scenario: A limited number of plans should be displayed per page and I should be able to move through the pages to see more plans
