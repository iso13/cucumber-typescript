Feature: Sort census
  As a Producer
  I need to be able to sort my census by member data
  So I can see members data in order that best suits my workflow

  @review
  Scenario: Every column on the census should have a header displayed at the top of the census

  Scenario: Fields on the census should be able to be sorted in ascending and descending order

  Scenario: Dependents should not be sorted and should stay nested under their employees after sorting takes place

  Scenario: Empty census values should be sorted last in the list
