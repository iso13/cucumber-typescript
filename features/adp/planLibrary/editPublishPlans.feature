Feature: Edit Publish plans
  As a OE or Sales OPs
  I want the ability to edit publish custom plans
  So I can make changes based on projects needs

  Scenario: Update plan information for medical, dental, vision, and life plans

  Scenario: Plans can be deleted.

  Scenario: Plans can be duplicated.

  Scenario: Plans dates can be updated.

  Scenario: Delete, Duplicate, Set Dates, Edit several plans at one time should work

  Scenario: A limited number of plans should be displayed per page and I should be able to move through the pages to see more plans
