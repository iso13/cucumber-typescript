Feature: Proposal permissions
  As a Producer
  I want access to my proposal limited
  So that only users in my organization and in the correct role can access my proposals

  Scenario: A proposal created by a producer should only be accessible to that producer and their super users

  Scenario: A proposal created by super user should only be accessible to super users in that org and parent org
