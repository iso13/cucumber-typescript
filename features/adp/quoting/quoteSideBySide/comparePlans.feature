Feature: Compare plans
  As a Producer
  I want to be able to compare my plans side by side
  So that I can make the best plan selection decisions for my client and their employees

  Scenario: Each plan side by side should have the same number of benefits

  Scenario: All plans should have values for each benefit

  Scenario: Compare plans by plan name

  Scenario: Distinguish between current, renewal, and real time plans

  Scenario: Current, renewal, and real time plans should have accurate employee counts per plan

  Scenario: Current, renewal, and real time plans should have accurate total costs per plan

  Scenario: 4-Tier and 3-Tier plans should show rate breakdowns for each plan

  Scenario: Life plans should show volume, ADD, and rate breakdowns

  Scenario: Carrier logos should display for each carrier plan and plan names should not include the carrier name

  Scenario: Marketplace logos should display for each marketplace plan and the carrier name should display in the plan name

  Scenario: A percentage difference from current quote costs should show for each plan
