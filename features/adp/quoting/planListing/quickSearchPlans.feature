Feature: Quick search plans
  As a Producer
  I need to be able to quickly search for plans by name
  So that I don't have to try scroll and find it amongst all available plans

  Scenario: Plans should be searchable by plan name, carrier and marketplace

  Scenario: Adding a plan should increment the count in the plan cart

  Scenario: Adding a plan on the quick search should have the plan added on the SBS listing
