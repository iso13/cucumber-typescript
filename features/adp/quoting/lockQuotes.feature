Feature: Lock quotes
  As a Producer
  I need quotes to lock when I attach them to a proposal
  So that proposals I am showing to a client are never changed

  Scenario: If I create a proposal with a quote that quote should gain the status of 'locked'

  Scenario: If a quote is locked I should not be able to save edits to a quote

  Scenario: If I duplicate a quote then the newly duplicated quote should be unlocked and editable
