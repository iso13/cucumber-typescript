Feature: Timestamp Quotes
  As a Producer
  I want my stamps to contain a timestamp
  So that I know when my quote was created or edited

  Scenario: A newly created quote should display the text "Created MM/DD/YY at HH:MM:SS PM" at the top of the quote card with the latest time

  Scenario: An edited quote should display the text "Revised MM/DD/YY at HH:MM:SS PM" at the top of the quote card with the latest time

  Scenario: A requoted quote should display the text "Revised MM/DD/YY at HH:MM:SS PM" at the top of the quote card with the latest time
