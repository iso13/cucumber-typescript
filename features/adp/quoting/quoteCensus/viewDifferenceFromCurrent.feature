Feature: View difference from current
  As a Producer
  I want to be able to see each employees costs difference from current
  So that I can provide them with the best plan to suit their financial needs

  Scenario: View EE difference from current by employee should only be available for medical

  Scenario: Each employee should have their current plans displayed below their selected plan for medical standard modeling

  Scenario: "Current EE Cost" and "New EE Cost" should be displayed using the cost for the employees current plan and selected plan

  Scenario: "$ Difference" and "% Difference" should display calculated based current and new EE costs

  Scenario: Increased EE costs should show a green down arrow icon and decreased EE costs should show a red up arrow icon
