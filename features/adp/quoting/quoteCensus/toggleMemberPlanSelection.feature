Feature: Toggle member plan selection
  As a Producer
  I want to be able to change a members selected plans
  So that I can make sure a clients employees are on the best plan for them

  Scenario: Dental, vision, Life, and Medical market snapshot should not allow individual plan selections. All employees must be on the same plan

  Scenario: Medical standard modeling should allow unique plan selection for each employee

  Scenario: Toggling individual employees plans should update employee and member rates

  Scenario: Medical Standard modeling quotes should have an All employee drop-down on the census page to change all member plan selection at once

  Scenario: Dental, vision, Life, and medical market snapshot should have an all employee plan selection drop-down on the contribution strategy page that updates all employees plan selection
