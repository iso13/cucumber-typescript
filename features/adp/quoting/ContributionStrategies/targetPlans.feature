Feature: Target plans
  As a Producer
  I want to have a way to target my contribution calculation based on a plan that members are not on
  So that clients can focus their contributions on a given plan

  Scenario: Target plan functionality should not be available for medical market snapshots, dental, vision, or life

  Scenario: Set a target plan that is more expensive than a members selected plan (dep rollover should be turned off)

  Scenario: Set a target plan that is cheaper than a members selected plan (dep rollover should be turned off)

  Scenario: Set a target plan that is the same price as a members selected plan (dep rollover should be turned off)

  Scenario: Set a target plan that is more expensive than a members selected plan and dependent rollover is turned on
