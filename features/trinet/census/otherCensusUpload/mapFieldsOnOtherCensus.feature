Feature: Map Other Census Fields
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to map my fields from a census file(xls, xlsx or csv) to fields in quotepad
  So that I can quickly setup a groups census and start quoting

  @critical
  Scenario: confirm other census can be imported to a group sucessfully

  Scenario: Set the header row via both the drop-down and clicking from the sample row displayed

  Scenario: Set the mapping for each field in your census and confirm they upload successfully

  Scenario: Field should display "We found a match!", when Fields from the census file are automatically mapped to quotepad census fields

  Scenario: Sample data from the census file should be displayed when mapping so that a user can accurately map fields

  Scenario: Skipping column for unmapped fields should be possible

  Scenario: Skipped field can be viewed when checking checkbox - Show skipped data

  Scenario: Unmatched fields should be highlighted in red and display a message "Match your data"

  Scenario: If all fields have not been matched or skipped we should not be able to continue uploading the census

  Scenario: Date of birth and date of higher can set the date type being used such as MM/DD/YY etc.
