Feature: Map coverage tiers on other census
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to map my custom coverage tiers used as my Brokerage to quotepad coverage tiers
  So that I can correctly coverage tier when quoting

  @blocker
  Scenario: Coverage tiers mapped should be imported correctly to the census

  @critical
  Scenario: All coverage tiers must be mapped before I can upload my census

  Scenario: Coverage tiers should automatically detect and map fields the app recognizes
