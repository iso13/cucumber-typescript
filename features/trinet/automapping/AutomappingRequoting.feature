Feature: BCR to PCR requoting
  As a Broker
  I want all the employees in a BCR quote to be mapped to a PCR quote following the automapping logic after requoting
  So that I can reduce the time for employee selections.

  Scenario: After BCR to PCR requoting all members from BCR quote should be listed in the census tab for the PCR quote following the automapping logic

  Scenario: If no rates are set for the PCR exchange the BCR will be converted to, then BCR quote will be generated after requoting
