Feature: Display quote overview
  As an Underwriter
  I want to see a quote overview on quote cards
  So that I can quickly analyse quotes I intend on selling

  Scenario: Medical standard modeling should only show a total cost at the bottom of the quote overview

  Scenario: Medical standard modeling and renewal should display difference from current in the bottom right of the quote card

  Scenario: High chart costs should represent the same values as when you navigate into the quote

  Scenario: Plan count displays in the top right of the quote card
