Feature: Delete proposal
  As an Underwriter
  I want to delete proposals
  So that out of date proposals or proposal I do not need are removed from the proposal list

  Scenario: Delete a proposal from the proposal list

  Scenario: Delete a proposal and confirm that quotes on the proposal are unlocked if they are not on another quote
