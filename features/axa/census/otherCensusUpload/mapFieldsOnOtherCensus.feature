Feature: Map Field on other Census
  As an Underwriter
  I need to be able to map my fields from a census file(xls, xlsx or csv) to fields in Quotepad
  So that I can quickly set up a group's census

  Scenario: Set the header row via both the drop-down and clicking from the displayed sample row

  Scenario: Set the mapping for each field in your census and confirm they upload successfully

  Scenario: Fields from the census file should be automatically mapped to Quotepad census fields where we can determine the mapping. The field should display "We found a match!"

  Scenario: Sample data from the census file should be displayed when mapping so that a user can accurately map fields

  Scenario: If we don't want to map a field from the census then we should be able to skip individual fields. There should then be a checkbox to toggle displaying the skipped fields

  Scenario: Unmatched fields should be highlighted in red and display a message "Match your data"

  Scenario: If all fields have not been matched or skipped we should not be able to continue uploading the census

  Scenario: Date of birth and date of hire can set the date type being used (i.e. MM/DD/YY etc..)
