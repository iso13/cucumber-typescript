Feature: Build Census Template
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to build my own census templates
  So that I can have my custom company template stored for uploading without having to remap every time.

  Scenario: Upload a custom census via the Other Census upload feature and save the custom template. The census should now appear in the census template dropdown.

  Scenario: Upload a custom census using a previously saved census template and confirm all data is uploaded and mapped correctly

  Scenario: Upload a custom census with coverage tiers and confirm all tiers are mapped correctly
