Feature: Delete census members
  As an Underwriter
  I need to be able to delete census members
  So I can accurately quote a group for my client

  Scenario: Delete an employee with no dependent from my census

  Scenario: Delete a child dependent from a EC1 employee from my census and have the employees tier update to EE

  Scenario: Delete a spouse dependent from a ES employee from my census and have the employees tier update to EE

  Scenario: Delete a spouse dependent from a EF employee from my census and have the employees tier update to EC2 or EC1

  Scenario: Delete a child dependent from a EC2 employee from my census and have the employees tier update to EC1
