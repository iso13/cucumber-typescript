Feature: Delete FUP
  As an Underwriter
  I need to delete frequently used plans
  So that plans I no longer use do not congest the UI

  Scenario: Delete a Dental, Vision, Basic Life, STD, LTD, Supplemental Life, Voluntary Life plan

  Scenario: A deleted plan should no longer be available to any group
