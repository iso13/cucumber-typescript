Feature: Voluntary Life plan design
  As an Underwriter
  I want to have plan designs for life

  Scenario: Supplemental Life plan designs should have all the benefits and benefit types I need to create plans similar to published plans on the market

  Scenario: Benefits presets should be available to easily configure new life plans
