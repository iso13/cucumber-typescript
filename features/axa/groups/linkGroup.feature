Feature: Link group
  As an Underwriter
  I need to be able to link groups and set dual activity
  So that I can easily identify similar groups or groups that are the same

  Scenario: When typing a group's name I should be prompted to select a name from a group that I already have access to. I should be prompted to link the group if I do select a group from the dropdown

  Scenario: When I link a group I should be able to access that linked group from the 'view linked groups' button

  Scenario: The 'view linked groups' button should contain the number of groups that are linked to this group

  Scenario: Search for groups I want to link from within the link group dialog. Only groups I have access to should show as an option.

  Scenario: Set dual activity for 1 linked group

  Scenario: Remove linked groups from a group profile

  Scenario: Linked groups should be easily identifiable in the groups list via a linked group icon

  Scenario: Dual Activity groups should be easily identifiable in the groups list via a dual activity icon

  Scenario: Creating a new group with a linked group should allow the user to transfer census/classes, plans to the new group from the linked group

  Scenario: A group can not be deleted from the group list if the group is linked or dual activity
