Feature: Review Accident Plan Design
  As a Requester
  I want to be able to see correct set of benefits and set values for them
  So I can setup my Accident custom plan for further quoting

  Scenario: Plan design should have a correct set of benefits

  Scenario: All benefits should be represented with a correct control (have correct type and format)

  Scenario: All benefits should have correct set of available values

  Scenario: All benefits should display in the precise/defined order

  Scenario: Plan design should have correct set of Basic benefits

  Scenario: Plan design should have correct set of Detailed benefits

  Scenario: All benefits should have correct default/readable values

  Scenario: Dependency logic for all benefits should apply correctly
  #description for the scenario is too generic though

  Scenario: Benefit presets should be available to configure new plan easily
