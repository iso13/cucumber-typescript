Feature: Review Quote Availability
  As a QuotePad user
  I want to have quote access defined based on my user role and quote status
  So that only users I want to view quotes can access them

  Scenario: A quote created by a Requester should only be accessible to that Requester and its super users

  Scenario: A quote created by super user should only be accessible to super users

  Scenario: A Requester should only be able to view a quote created by a super user only after it has been explicitly released to Requester
