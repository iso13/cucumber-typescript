Feature: Lock Quotes
  As a Requester
  I need quotes to lock when I include them into a proposal
  So the data in proposal and related quotes remains consistent

  Scenario: Quote included into a proposal should gain the status of 'Locked'

  Scenario: Locked quote can not be deleted

  Scenario: Locked quote should become unlocked, if related proposal was deleted
