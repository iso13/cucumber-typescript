Feature: Filter Quotes
  As a Requester
  I should be able to filter quotes of a group by product line
  So that I can easily find the quote I am looking for

  Scenario: Filter by product dropdown contains only those product lines that are enabled for a group

  @major
  Scenario: Selecting a product line results in displaying of quotes created for that product line only
