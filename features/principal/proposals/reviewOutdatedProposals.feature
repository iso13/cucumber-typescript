Feature: Review Outdated Proposals
  As a Requester
  I would like my proposals to be marked as outdated, once group/census info gets updated
  So that I can present only the most recent and up-to-date information to my client

  Scenario: Outdated proposal is marked with warning icon on the list of proposals

  Scenario: Outdated proposal warning message displays on proposals list page

  Scenario: Proposal becomes outdated after any change made to group info

  Scenario: Proposal becomes outdated after any change made to census info
