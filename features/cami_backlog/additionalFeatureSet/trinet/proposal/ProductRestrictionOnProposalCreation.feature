Feature: Product Restriction On Proposal Creation
  As a User
  I need restriction while proposal creation to have minimum products on proposals output

  Scenario: User should be able to select only 1 quote of any particular product when creating proposal

  Scenario: User should not be able to create Proposal until required product line quotes are selected
  #Exchange III is selected - one Medical and one Life quotes are required
  #Other Exchanges -Medical is required

  Scenario: User Validation is required when selecting another quote for product line already selected
