Feature: Auto Skipping Screen
  As a User
  I need to filter screens to be auto-skipped
  So that I don't have to select filters and carrier each time for quote creation

  Scenario: Auto-skip screen when creating Market-Snapshot Quote
  #Auto Skip Package/ Benefit Filter screen/ Plan Selection Screen

  Scenario: Don't skip screens when creating Standard-Modeling Quote
  #Auto Skip Package/ Benefit Filter screen/ Plan Selection Screen

  Scenario: For Exchange with single package, package selection screen is skipped for SM quotes

  Scenario: For Exchange with multiple package, package selection screen is not skipped for Market Snapshot quotes
