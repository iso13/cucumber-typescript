Feature: Display Census Data on Quote
  As a User
  I want to be able to see census data on quote modeling
  So that I can manage plan assignments and see members cost breakdowns

  Scenario: Display data for each census member (both employee and dependent) on quote census

  Scenario: ACA Age-Rated quotes should have rates broken down for each employee and each dependent

  Scenario: 4-Tier Medical quotes should have an EE Rate and a combined DEP Rate broken down

  Scenario: Dental, vision, and life quotes should not have a breakdown of EE or DEP Rates

  Scenario: Dental, vision, and medical quotes should have a coverage tier beside each member

  Scenario: By default all census members are assigned to the lowest cost plan on a quote

  Scenario: Update individual members' plan assignment on quote census

  Scenario: Update members' plan assignment on quote census in a bulk

  Scenario: Display cost difference between newly assigned plan and current coverage plan

  Scenario: Filter census members by state on quote census

  Scenario: Filter census members by ZIP code on quote census
