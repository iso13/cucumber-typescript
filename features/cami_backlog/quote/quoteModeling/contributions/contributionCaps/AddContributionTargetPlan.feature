Feature: Add Contribution Target Plan
  As a User
  I want to be able to add a target plan for my contributions
  So that I can only contribution against the plan of my chosing and not the employees choice

  Scenario: Add a target plan to a contribution class that exceeds an employees selected plan in rates

  Scenario: Add a target plan to a contribution class that is less than the employees selected plan in rates

  Scenario: Add a target plan to a contribution class that is the same as the employees selected plan in rates

  Scenario: Add a target plan to a contribution class that causes DMFL to be triggered

  Scenario: Switch between target plans

  Scenario: Switch from a target plan to no target plan
