Feature: Add Dollar Funding Cap
  As a User
  I want the ability to set contribution caps based on a dollar amount
  So that employer contributions can be capped on a dollar amount they want to contribute

  Scenario: Add a funding cap dollar amount and confirm contributions are capped

  Scenario: Add a funding cap dollar amount that an employees plan does not hit and as a result is not capped

  Scenario: Test that dollar funding cap can only be applied for employer contributions and percentage type contributions

  Scenario: Switch between funding cap plan being on and off

  Scenario: Add a funding cap dollar amount that is less than the DMFL
