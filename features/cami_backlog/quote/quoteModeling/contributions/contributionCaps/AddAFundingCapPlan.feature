Feature: Add Funding Cap Plan
  As a User
  I want the ability to have a plan used to cap contributions
  So that employer contributions can be capped based on a plan of their choice

  Scenario: Add a funding cap plan and confirm contributions are capped based on that plans rates

  Scenario: Add a funding cap plan that an employees plan does not hit the cap

  Scenario: Test that funding cap plans can only be applied for employer contributions and percentage type contributions

  Scenario: Switch between funding cap plan being on and off

  Scenario: Add a funding cap plan that triggers DMFL when applied
