  I want to be able to add percentage based contributions
  So that I can have costs updated based on contribution percentages

  Scenario: Add valid dollar values

    #Also test across quote types and rate structures
  Scenario: Enter dollar for different contribution combinations

  Scenario: Switch between contribution types
