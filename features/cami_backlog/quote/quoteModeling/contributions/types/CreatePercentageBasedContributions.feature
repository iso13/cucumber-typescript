Feature: Create Percentage Based Contributions
  As a User
  I want to be able to add percentage based contributions
  So that I can have costs updated based on contribution percentages

  Scenario: Add percentage values that are invalid

  Scenario: Add valid percentage values

    #Also test across quote types and rate structures. See current QPSL tests for examples
  Scenario: Enter percentages for different contribution combinations
