Feature: Default Contribution Strategy
  As a User
  I would like contribution strategies to be defaulted on quote creation
  So that initial quote, plan and member costs are set

  Scenario: Create a new quote and confirm default contributions are set by organization configuration

    #should inherit default strategy by class from current
  Scenario: Create a new quote on a group that contains a current quote

  Scenario: Create a new quote on a group that contains a current quote but which triggers a contribution cap
