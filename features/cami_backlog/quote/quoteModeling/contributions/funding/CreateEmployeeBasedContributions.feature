Feature: Create Employee Based Contributions
  As a User
  I want to be able to create contribution strategies that are funded by employees
  So that I can only contribute how much an employee is willing to allow

    #Also test across quote types and rate structures
  Scenario: Create employee contributions with differing contribution combinations

  Scenario: Switch between contribution funding types and confirm contributions are updated
