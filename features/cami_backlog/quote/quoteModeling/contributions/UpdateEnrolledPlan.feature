Feature: Update enrolled plan
  As a User
  I want the ability to set an enrolled plan for a class and contribution strategy
  So that I can have contribution strategies applied to a single plan for a class

    #Cost checks required
  Scenario: Add an enrolled plan for multiple classes

  Scenario: Set an enrolled plan to none
