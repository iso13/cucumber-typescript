Feature: Quote Availability
  As a User
  I should have access to quotes, which are available to me based on my user role and quote status
  So that only users I want to view quotes can access them

  Scenario: A quote created by a user should only be accessible to that user and its super users

  Scenario: A quote created by super user should only be accessible to super users

  Scenario: A user should only be able to view a quote created by a super user only after it's been released by superuser
