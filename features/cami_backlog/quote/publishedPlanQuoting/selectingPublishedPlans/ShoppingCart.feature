Feature: Shopping Cart
  As a User
  I need to be able to see what plans I have selected thus far in one place
  So that I can provide my clients the plans that best suits their needs

  Scenario: Adding a plan should increment the count in the plan cart

  Scenario: When a plan is removed the cart icon should decrease in count by 1 and that plan name should no longer be displayed in the cart

  Scenario: Remove individual plans from the within the shopping cart

  Scenario: Remove all plans from within the shopping card
