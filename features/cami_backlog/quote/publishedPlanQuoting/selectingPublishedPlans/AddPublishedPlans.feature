Feature: Add Published Plans to Quote
  As a User
  I need to be able to add published plans to new quotes easily
  So that I don't have to scroll and find it amongst all available plans

  Scenario: Add published plan from the side-by-side list of plans

  Scenario: Plans should be quick searchable by plan name, carrier and marketplace

  Scenario: Adding a plan on the quick search should have the plan added on the SBS listing

  Scenario: Add all published plans

  Scenario: Benefits display for every published plan on the side-by-side list

  Scenario: Sort published plans by carrier

  Scenario: Sort published plans by plan type

  Scenario: Filter published plans by ZIP code

  Scenario: Filter published plans by state
