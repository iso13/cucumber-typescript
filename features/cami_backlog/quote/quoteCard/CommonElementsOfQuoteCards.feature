Feature: Common Elements Of Quote Cards
  As a User
  I want my quote cards to contain few common elements
  So that I know my quote name, number of plans included and time, when it was created or edited

  Scenario: Quote name displays at the top of the card

  Scenario: Quote name may be changed and saved at the top of the card

  Scenario: A newly created quote should display the timestamp "Created..." at the top of the quote card

  Scenario: An edited quote should display the timestamp "Revised..." at the top of the quote card
