Feature: Lock Quotes
  As a User
  I need quotes to lock when I include them into a proposal
  So that proposals I am showing to a client are never changed

  Scenario: Quote included into proposal is non-editable (locked)

  Scenario: Locked quote gets unlocked when related proposal is deleted

  Scenario: Locked quote remains locked, when only one of the related few proposals is deleted
