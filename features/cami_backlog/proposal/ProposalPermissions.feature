Feature: Proposal Permissions
  As a User
  I want access to my proposal limited
  So that only users in my organization and in the correct role can access my proposals

  Scenario: Proposals should be visible for the admin users, primary owners and secondary consultants defined for the group

  Scenario: Primary owner should not be able to delete or modify certain proposals

  Scenario: Secondary Consultant should not be able to delete or modify certain proposals
