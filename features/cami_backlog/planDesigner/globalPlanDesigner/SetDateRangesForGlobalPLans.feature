Feature: Set Date Ranges for Global Plan's Availability and Effectiveness
  As a User
  I want to be able to set both Available Dates Range and Effective Dates range for my global plans
  So that I can allow/disallow my clients to quote these plans at certain point of time

  * The feature was used long time ago on ADP and was presented to PFG a couple of times,
  * but feels like it's currently forgotten and almost abandoned (but it's there).
  * Before writing any scenario we need to understand if we need them or not.

  Scenario: Set Date Ranges
