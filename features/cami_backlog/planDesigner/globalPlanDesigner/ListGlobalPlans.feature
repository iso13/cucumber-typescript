Feature: List of Global Plans
  As a User
  I want to be able to see the list of all global plans
  So that I can manage them efficiently

  * The feature was used long time ago on ADP and was presented to PFG a couple of times,
  * but feels like it's currently forgotten and almost abandoned (but it's there).
  *  Before writing any scenario we need to understand if we need them or not.
