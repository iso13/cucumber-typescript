Feature: Navigate Through Plan Design Benefits
  As a User
  I want to be able to navigate through available benefits for any plan design
  So it's easier to find the benefit I need, or the one, that requires some action

  * "Detailed Benefits" button displays by default, if all benefits have valid values
  * "Show Errors" button displays by default, if some benefits require action to be taken
  * Show all (both basic and detailed) benefits of a plan
  * Show Basic benefits of a plan
  * Show plan design benefits, that require action to be taken
  * "Show Errors" mode displays both basic and detailed invalidated benefits
  * No invalid benefits left, benefit view mode switches to "Basic Benefits"
  * No invalid benefits left, "Show Errors" button doesn't show up anymore

  Scenario: Navigate Through Plan Design Benefits
