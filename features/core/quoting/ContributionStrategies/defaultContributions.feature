Feature: Default contributions
  As a Broker
  I want the contributions for my real time quotes to inherit the values of my current quote
  So that I can closely mimic the contribution strategy of my client current coverage

  Scenario: Medical percent contributions for 4-Tier composite current should be the default contribution value for new quotes

  Scenario: Medical percent contributions for ACA Age-Rated current should be the default contribution value for new quotes

  Scenario: Medical dollar contributions for 4-Tier composite current should be the default contribution value for new quote

  Scenario: Medical dollar contributions for ACA Age-Rated current should be the default contribution value for new quotes
