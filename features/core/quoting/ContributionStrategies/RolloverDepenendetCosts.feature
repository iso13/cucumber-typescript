Feature: Rollover dependent costs
  As a Broker
  I want to be able to use rollover my employee contributions to my dependents
  So that I can use all the contributions being provided by my employer

  Scenario: Dental, life, and vision do not have the capability of rolling over contributions

  Scenario: Dependent rollover should only be allowed for standard modeling percent contributions when a target plan has been selected and should always be allowed for dollar contributions

  Scenario: Dependent rollover should not be allowed for market snapshot percent contributions but should be allowed for dollar contributions

  Scenario: DEP rollover can not exceed the dep rate for either dollar or percent contributions

  Scenario: DEP rollover should rollover unused contributions from employees onto dependents costs for dollar contributions
