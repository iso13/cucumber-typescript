Feature: Build benefit comparisons
  As a Broker
  I want to build benefit comparisons
  So that I can quickly identify the differences between benefits on plans

  Scenario: Benefit differences are only available for medical

  @critical @jorge
  Scenario: Any plan can be as a base comparison including current and renewal plans

  Scenario: Re-order plans in the comparison side by side

  Scenario: Remove a plan from the benefit comparison side by side

  Scenario: Add a plan to the benefit comparison side by side

  Scenario: Add all plans to the benefit comparison with one click

  Scenario: Remove all plans from the benefit comparison with one click

  Scenario: My base plan should not be removable

  Scenario: Benefit with no difference should show no benefit difference icon

  Scenario: Benefits that can not be compared should show a yellow icon with a not equal sign

  Scenario: Benefits with an improvement should show an up arrow in green

  Scenario: Benefits with a decrease in quality should show a down arrow in red
