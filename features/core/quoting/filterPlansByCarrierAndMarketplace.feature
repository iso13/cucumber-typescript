Feature: Filter plans by carrier and marketplace
  As a Broker
  I want to filter available plans by carrier and marketplace
  So that I can quote only the carriers and marketplaces I want

  Scenario: Select multiple carrier for quoting

  Scenario: Marketplaces should have carriers nested within them. Individual carriers should be selectable at an individual level

  Scenario: I should be able to select all and select none via one click

  @critical @jorge
  Scenario: Selecting a single carrier should result in only plans for that carrier showing on the benefit filter
