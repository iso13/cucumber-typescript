Feature: Create FUP
  As a Broker
  I want to create frequently used plans
  So that I can save time and reuse common custom plans across groups

  @critical @MSTR-1497
  Scenario: Add a medical, dental, vision, and life plan to frequently used plans

  Scenario: Newly added plans should be displayed at the top of the frequently used plans list

  Scenario: Newly added plans should be available to all groups and not just the group the plan was created in

  Scenario: Plans that are not valid (missing benefits, rates etc..) can not be added to the frequently used plans list
