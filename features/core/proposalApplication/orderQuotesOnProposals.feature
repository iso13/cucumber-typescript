Feature: Order quotes on proposals
  As a Broker
  I want the ability to order the quotes on a proposal
  So that I can present a proposal to my clients with the quotes ordered based on their priority

  Scenario: When a quote is added to the proposal the quote cart count should increment by 1

  Scenario: When a quote is removed from the proposal the quote cart count should decrement by 1

  Scenario: Order quotes on a proposal

  Scenario: Quotes can be ordered but product lines can not be ordered
