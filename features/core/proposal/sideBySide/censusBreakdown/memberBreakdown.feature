Feature: Member breakdown
  As a Broker
  I want my census to be broken down by members and their costs
  So that I can provide my clients with a low level cost breakdown for each quote

  @critical @diego
  Scenario: Current, renewal, and real time standard modeling medical quotes should be included on the census breakdown

  @critical @diego
  Scenario: All census employees, including waived employees, should be included on the census breakdown

  Scenario: Logos for all carriers included on each quote should be displayed

  Scenario: Each employee should have their first name, last name, and age displayed

  Scenario: Each quote should have the employees plan selection for that quote as well as their tier breakdown

  Scenario: The cost breakdown for each employee (EE, ER, and Total cost) should be displayed

  Scenario: The employee difference from current should be calculated and displayed for each employee on each quote (except current quotes)

  Scenario: Waived members should have no plan selection and no cost breakdown
