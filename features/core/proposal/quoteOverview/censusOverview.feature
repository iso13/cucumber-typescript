Feature: Census overview
  As a Broker
  I want a census overview displayed on each quote overview
  So that I can give my client an accurate census overview and how they correspond to the cost of the quote

  Scenario: Census count should be broken down by tier

  @critical
  Scenario: There should be a count broken down by number of employees vs number of dependents

  Scenario: The number of total covered lives should be displayed (This does not included waived or non eligible members)

  Scenario: There should be a separate waived count that shows the number of waiving employees, number of waiving dependents, and the number of waiving members
