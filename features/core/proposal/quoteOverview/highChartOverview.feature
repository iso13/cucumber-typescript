Feature: High chart overview
  As a Broker
  I want a quote overview with a high chart overview of my quote
  So that I can visually present the quote breakdown to my client

  Scenario: The quote name should display in the top left of the page below the product line name

  Scenario: High chart costs should be broken down into 3 high charts, current, renewal, and real time

  Scenario: Quote overview page should only display for standard modeling quotes or market snapshot quotes with only 1 plan

  Scenario: High charts for current, renewal, and real time quotes should be broken down by EE cost, ER cost, and Total cost

  Scenario: Renewal and real time quotes should have a percentage difference for each data point (EE, ER, and total cost)

  Scenario: The overview should be dynamic based on whether current and renewal are available. If they are not then the real time quote should use the full space
