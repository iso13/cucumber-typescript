Feature: Plans overview
  As a Broker
  I want visibility into what plans are included on a quote
  So I can have better visibility into a quote when trying to sell to a client

  Scenario: All plans on the real time quote should be displayed by plan name

  Scenario: Each plan should have a plan selection count beside the plans

  Scenario: Plans should be ordered by plan selection count

  Scenario: If there are too many plans to display then the user should be informed to view simple side by side page for the full list
