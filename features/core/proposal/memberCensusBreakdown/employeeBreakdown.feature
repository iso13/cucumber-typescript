Feature: Employee breakdown
  As a Broker
  I would like a census breakdown of each quote
  So that I can see the census that quote is using and how each quote is using the census

  Scenario: The quote's contribution strategy should be displayed above the table

  Scenario: Each employee should have their first and last name displayed next to their data

  Scenario: Dependents should have their first and last name nested below their employee

  Scenario: If a member is out of state then the member's state abbreviation should be displayed in red

  Scenario: Each member's age should be displayed in the table data

  Scenario: Each member's medical coverage tier should be displayed in the table data with a count of the total number of member's in that household

  Scenario: Each employee should have their selected plan displayed

  Scenario: For both ACA Age-Rated quotes and 4 Tier-Composite quotes the EE rate should be displayed for employees

  Scenario: For ACA Age-Rated quotes there should be a total DEP rate displayed as well as a breakdown of each dependents rates

  Scenario: For 4 Tier-Composite quotes there should be a total DEP rate displayed but there should not be a rate breakdown for each dependent

  Scenario: Each employee should have a total rate displayed

  Scenario: Each employee should have an EE cost and an ER cost displayed based on the contribution model on the quote
