Feature: Monthly cost breakdown
  As a Broker
  I would like a monthly cost breakdown of each quote
  So that I can see the census that quote is using and how much the quote will cost on a monthly basis

  Scenario: Total monthly breakdown should be displayed for EE Rate, DEP Rate, Total Rate, EE Cost, and ER Cost
