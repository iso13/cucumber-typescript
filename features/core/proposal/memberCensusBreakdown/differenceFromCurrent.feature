Feature: Difference from current
  As a Broker
  I would like an annual difference from current displayed
  So that I can see the annual cost and how much it differs from a clients current quote

  Scenario: The current annual cost should be displayed for both EE Cost and ER Cost. This should be calculated using the current quotes contribution strategy

  Scenario: $ Difference per year should be displayed for EE Cost and ER Cost

  Scenario: % Difference per year should be displayed for EE Cost and ER Cost
