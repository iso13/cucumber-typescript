Feature: Annual cost breakdown
  As a Broker
  I would like an annual cost breakdown of each quote
  So that I can see the census that quote is using and how much the quote will cost on an annual basis

  Scenario: Total annual breakdown should be displayed for EE Rate, DEP Rate, Total Rate, EE Cost, and ER Cost
