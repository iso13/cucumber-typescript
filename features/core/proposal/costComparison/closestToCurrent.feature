Feature: Closest to current
  As a Broker
  I want to compare the costs of plans in a market
  So that I can determine the one that is closest to my current quote

  Scenario: The plan that is closest to the current quote by % difference should be highlighted in the table

  Scenario: At the bottom of the page, if current exists then a list of plans within 5% of current total cost should be displayed

  Scenario: If current does not exist on the proposal then there should be no highlighting of any plans or grouping of plans closest to current
