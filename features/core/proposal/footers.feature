@core @proposal @footer @wip
Feature: Footers
  As a Broker
  I want the footer of the proposal to provide general data
  So that the client can always have access to crucial group data

  Scenario: A warning/disclaimer should display informing the client that the rates are for illustrative purposes only

  Scenario: Additional group and proposal data should display on the footer
