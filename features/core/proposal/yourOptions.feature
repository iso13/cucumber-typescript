Feature: Your options
  As a Broker
  I want my proposal to have a page separating each product line
  So that my client understand when a new product line is starting

  Scenario: Core logos should display for each product line

  Scenario: Each options page should clearly display what product line is starting

  Scenario: Product lines should display in the order medical, dental, vision, and life
