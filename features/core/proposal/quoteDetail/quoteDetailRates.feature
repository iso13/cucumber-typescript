Feature: Quote detail rates
  As a Broker
  I want a page where my ancillary quote can be broken down in consumable information
  So that I can easily review quote rate information with my client

  Scenario: Rates for dental and vision quotes should be broken down by tier for both 4 tier and 3 tier

  Scenario: For life quotes the rates table should be on a different page and should only be displayed for real time quotes

  Scenario: The rates table for life should display rate information for each employee with each members first name, last name, age, and gender all displaying

  Scenario: The rates table for life should display the following rate information for each employee: Benefit, Life, AD&D, and Premium

  @critical @jorge
  Scenario: The quotes census total volume and total monthly premium should be displayed
