Feature: Enrollment steps
  As a Broker
  I want to have enrollment steps outlined
  So that I can make enrolling as easy as possible for my clients

  Scenario: A 3 step plan should be provided informing clients how to enroll members

  Scenario: A 2 step plan should be provided informing clients how to waive members

  Scenario: Provide a signature line and date line for clients to sign up for enrollment
