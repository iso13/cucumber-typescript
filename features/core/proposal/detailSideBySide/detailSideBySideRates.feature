Feature: Detail side by side rates
  As a Broker
  I would like to see a rate breakdown for each plan
  So that I can be better informed on each plan when presenting to a client

  Scenario: ACA Age-Rated plans should not display a rate breakdown and instead should display 'Age Rated'

  Scenario: For 4 tier composite plans each tier should have its own cell with a rate for each tier
