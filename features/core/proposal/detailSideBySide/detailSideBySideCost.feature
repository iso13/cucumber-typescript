Feature: Detail side by side cost
  As a Broker
  I want my costs for each plan on a quote displayed side by side
  So I can use costs as a factor in plan selection

  Scenario: Each plan should have a count of the number of members that have selected that plan

  Scenario: Total monthly cost should be calculated as the cost for the entire quote and not just each individual plan

  Scenario: Total difference (from current) should be calculated as the difference for the entire quote and not just each individual plan. The difference should be displayed using both dollar and percentage difference
