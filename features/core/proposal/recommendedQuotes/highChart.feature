Feature: High chart
  As a Broker
  I want a high chart breakdown for each of my recommended quotes
  So that I can present to my clients with the most important data consolidated and displayed on one page

  @critical @jorge
  Scenario: High charts for each product line's recommended quote should be displayed

  @critical @jorge
  Scenario: Each high chart should display the total monthly cost in the middle of the chart

  Scenario: Each high chart should display the number of employees on the quote

  Scenario: Costs on the high chart should be broken down into employee and employer costs
