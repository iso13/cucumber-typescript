Feature: Recommended monthly costs
  As a Broker
  I want the costs of all my recommended quotes consolidated
  So that I can determine how much full coverage on all lines would cost

  Scenario: Total monthly premium should be calculated based on all recommended quotes

  Scenario: Employee cost should be calculated based on all recommended quotes

  Scenario: Employer cost should be calculated based on all recommended quotes

  Scenario: Total, EE, and ER costs should all have a difference from current calculated and displayed
