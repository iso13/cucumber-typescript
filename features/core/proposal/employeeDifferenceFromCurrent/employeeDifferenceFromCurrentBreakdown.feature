Feature: Employee difference from current breakdown
  As a Broker
  I want a comparison page for employees and their old costs
  So that I can give my clients a representation of employee costs and the differences from their current quote

  Scenario: The quotes contribution strategy and quote effective date should be displayed above the table

  Scenario: Each employee should have their first and last name displayed next to their data

  Scenario: Each employee's medical coverage tier should be displayed in the table data with a count of the total number of members in that household

  Scenario: Current EE Cost should be displayed for each employee

  Scenario: Each employee's current selected plan should be displayed with the full plan name including carrier name. Members with no plan should display an empty data cell

  Scenario: New EE cost should be displayed for each employee. The new cost should represent the EE cost for an employee on the new real time quote

  Scenario: Each member's selected plan for the new real time quote should be displayed in the table. If an employee does not have a plan then the plan selection should show as empty

  Scenario: $ difference and % difference should show for each employee. Negative dollar values should show a minus
