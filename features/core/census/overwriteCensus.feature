Feature: Overwrite Census
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to overwrite the census on my group
  So I can accurately quote a group for my client

  Scenario: Upload a new census via the QuotePad census template and verify that the group's members were replaced with the members on the new census

  Scenario: Upload a new census via the other census feature and verify that the group's members were replaced with the members on the new census
