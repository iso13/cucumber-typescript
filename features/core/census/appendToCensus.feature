Feature: Append Census
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to append members to my census via uploading a census
  So that I can add new members to my client's group

  Scenario: Upload a new census via the QuotePad template to my group that will add new members and not clear old members

  Scenario: Upload a new census via the other census feature to my group that will add new members and not clear old members
