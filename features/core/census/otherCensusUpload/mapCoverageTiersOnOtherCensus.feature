Feature: Map coverage tiers on other census
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to map my custom coverage tiers used as my Brokerage to Quotepad coverage tiers
  So that I can correctly assign employee coverage tiers when quoting

  @critical
  Scenario: Coverage tiers should be imported correctly to the census

  Scenario: Coverage tiers should automatically detect and map recognized fields

  Scenario: All coverage tiers must be mapped before the census finishes uploading
