Feature: Display member data
  As a Broker
  I want to review quote member data
  So that I can understand members cost breakdowns

  Scenario: Display of both employee and dependents on the quote census

  Scenario: ACA Age-Rated quotes should have rates broken down for each employee and each dependent

  Scenario: 4-Tier Medical quotes should have an EE Rate and a combined DEP Rate broken down

  Scenario: Dental, vision, and life quotes should not have a breakdown of EE or DEP Rates

  Scenario: Dental, vision, and medical quotes should have a coverage tier beside each member

  Scenario: Each member on the census should have their first and last name displayed

  Scenario: Each employees state abbreviation should be displayed

  Scenario: The zip code for each employee should be displayed

  Scenario: Each employees selected plan should be displayed

  Scenario: Each employee + dependents EE, ER and Total cost should be displayed based on rate and contributions
