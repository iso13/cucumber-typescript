Feature: List groups
  As a QuotePad user
  I need to be able view a list of groups that I have access to
  So that I can search for groups that I want to sell to

  @critical
  Scenario: Groups should be nested on the group list if they contain the same group name, Broker, and product lines

  @critical
  Scenario: Delete a group from the list

  Scenario: Groups are searchable via group name
