Feature: Edit census members
  As a Broker
  I need to be able to edit members on my group's census
  So I can accurately quote a group for my client

  Scenario: Update an employee's census information

  Scenario: Update a dependent's census information and have that information accurately represented on quotes

  Scenario: Update an employee's zip code to a state outside the group state and verify that the Out-of-State EEs count has incremented

  Scenario: Employee and dependent's ages should be calculated based on the group's quote effective date
