Feature: Create Custom Plans
  As a Broker
  I want the ability to create custom plans
  So I can replicate published carrier plans and sell them to my clients

  Scenario: Create a life plan and save the plan

  Scenario: Create a medical plan and save the plan

  Scenario: Create a dental plan and save the plan

  Scenario: Create a vision plan and save the plan

  Scenario: A plan must have a plan name and can not be created unless all benefits have been set as well as rates and a carrier

  Scenario: Saved plans should be stored on the left hand side of plan designer with a saved icon beside the plan name

  Scenario: Plans created but not saved should not have a saved icon and I should be prompted to save the plan when leaving the page
